# spin and rotations    
As spin is based on rotations it is essential to have a good understanding of the different types of rotations and the rotational algebras and number types.


# Rotations and algebras of rotational numbery types.
-	Everyone is familiar with the real numbers and the rules for the operations you can do with them – addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations and their rules are called an algebra, in this case it’s called a normed division algebra and the algebra is said to be over the reals. 
-	The real numbers describe a scalar quantity, and we combine multiple axis of real numbers to describe the familiar 2D and 3D space. For historical reasons these linear spaces are called Euclidean space. The real numbers let us describe linear motion in these spaces. There are three other number types for which a normed division algebra works. These types of numbers all describe rotations of different types. For historical reasons the numbers have misleading names, Complex, Quaternion and Octionion. 
-	They are the 2,4 and 8 dimensional numbers that describe 2D,3D and 4D rotations. The rotation that we are familiar with is a 2D rotation of 3D objects in out 3D space.
