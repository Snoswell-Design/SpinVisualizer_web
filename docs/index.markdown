In 2008 we developed a real-time spin visualization system for our own use. We did this to better understand spin of the fermions (electrons, protons and neutrons) with the goal of developing ways to tap spin energy.

We are now making this 3D web version of the spin visualizer freely available. This is in a state of rapid update as we add features from our internal visualization system.

The current version of this website is entirely unfinished. The only post with 3D visualizations is the [Bra-Ket Notation]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2023-02-01-bra-ket-notation.markdown %}) page.
